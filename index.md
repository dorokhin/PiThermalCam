## MLX90640 Thermal Camera with Raspberry Pi 4
{:.no_toc}

# Note: This page is still under construction. Check back later for the final version.

I recently purchased an MLX90640 Thermal Camera in order to evaluate the insulation/thermal leakage of my house. I connected this to a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). There were several such projects already online, and I ended up taking pieces of two as my baseline, mixing and matching and adding some features. The results of that work are placed here for others to use directly or as a baseline for further work.

Thanks are owed to those two projects: namely, Joshua Hrisko's [article at Maker Portal](https://makersportal.com/blog/2020/6/8/high-resolution-thermal-camera-with-raspberry-pi-and-mlx90640) and Валерий Курышев's [article under the name Walker2000 at Habr](https://habr.com/en/post/441050/). Their work was a BIG step forward as a starting point.
